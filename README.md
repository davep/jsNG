Small JavaScript library for reading Norton Guide database files.

This is still a bit of a work-in-progress. It is, in part, my "Hello, World"
for getting to know ES6-ish ways of coding, and also seeing what's possible
with node (which I've never used before to write CLI tools).

The code itself is mostly based on what I wrote for
the [`WEGLib`](https://github.com/davep/weg/tree/master/WEGLib) library that
forms part of [`weg`](https://github.com/davep/weg).

I don't offer this as good ES6 code. I don't offer this as good code at all.
At the moment I'm also not really considering taking contributions to the
code as this is still a pet project.

Anyone looking for background documentation for the format of Norton Guide
files might
find
[my page of documentation about it](http://davep.org/norton-guides/file-format/) useful.
