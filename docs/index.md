## Introduction

jsNG is a package that contains a library for reading Norton Guide database
files, plus some command line tools for working with them, the most notable
of which is `ngserve` -- a simple web server for serving up NG files as web
pages.

You can always get the latest version of jsNG
from [GitHub](https://github.com/davep/jsNG) as well as
from [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsng).

Please see the [ChangeLog](ChangeLog.md) for a history of the development
